# Load Test Results Report

## Test Configuration
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Peak VUs**: 500 concurrent users
- **Ramp-up Strategy**: 
  - 0-200 VUs in 2 minutes
  - 200-500 VUs in 1 minute
  - Maintain 500 VUs for 2 minutes

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- **Average Response Time**: 1250 ms
- **95th Percentile**: 1890 ms
- **99th Percentile**: 1950 ms
- **Maximum Response Time**: 2340 ms

### Throughput

## Potential Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Network Latency**
   - Average network latency: 245 ms
   - Impact on response times: Moderate impact observed during peak load periods, 
     contributing to approximately 20% of total response time

2. **Server Processing**
   - Average server processing time: 985 ms
   - CPU utilization: 78%
   - Memory usage: 82%

3. **Concurrent Connections**
   - Maximum concurrent connections: 482
   - Connection errors: 89
   - Connection timeouts: 111

## Performance Thresholds Status

- [x] 95% of requests completed under 2000ms
- [x] Error rate below 1%
- [x] User waiting time below 3000ms for 95% of requests

## Recommendations

1. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Implement connection pooling to handle concurrent connections more efficiently
   - Expected impact: 30% reduction in connection errors

2. **Code Optimizations**
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed user data
   - Expected impact: 40% reduction in average response time for GET requests

3. **Configuration Adjustments**
   - Increase connection timeout from 10s to 15s to reduce timeout errors
   - Expected impact: 50% reduction in timeout errors

## Test Environment

- **Test Location**: AWS us-east-1
- **Network Conditions**: 1Gbps connection, ~20ms baseline latency
- **Target Environment**: Mock API running on t3.large instance

## Conclusion

The system generally performed within acceptable thresholds, maintaining response times under 2000ms for 95% of requests. However, there are concerns about the increasing error rate (0.85%) as it approaches our 1% threshold. The primary bottleneck appears to be server processing time, which increases significantly under peak load.

Key observations:
1. System scales reasonably well up to 400 VUs
2. Performance degradation begins at ~450 VUs
3. Error rates increase notably during the final stage of 500 VUs

Immediate action is recommended on the caching implementation and connection pooling to improve system stability at peak loads.
